# Netlify Edge bundle

Requirements: Rust wasm target, `wasm-pack`, Node.js, and pnpm.

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm run build
pnpm run check
pnpm run dev
```

Configure `GPROXY_LIBSQL_URL` and `GPROXY_LIBSQL_AUTH_TOKEN` as sensitive
Netlify bindings. Optional `GPROXY_MASTER_KEY`, `GPROXY_MASTER_KEY_NEXT`, and
`GPROXY_MASTER_KEY_ROTATE` bindings control secret-at-rest encryption and
rotation. `UPSTASH_URL` and `UPSTASH_TOKEN` optionally select the shared
Upstash cache; set both or neither. The host builds a typed edge config from
these bindings. The build publishes the generated `public/` directory and
packages the ignored `pkg/` wasm output with the Edge Function.

The Edge Function is configured for all non-static paths; the public root,
exact admin and portal roots, `/assets/**`, and `/favicon.svg` stay on Netlify's
static layer. The entry uses `Context.ip` as the trusted client source and
registers any continuation with `Context.waitUntil`.

No WebSocket capability or shim is installed by this bundle. On Netlify's
runtime, WebSocket-intent requests therefore reach Rust and receive its explicit
501 response instead of silently degrading to HTTP.
